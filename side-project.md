### **Project Title**:  
**Smart Geolocation-Based Task Allocation System and Real-Time Customer Feedback**

### **Objectives**:  
- Develop a system that **automatically assigns tasks** to field agents based on their real-time geolocation and availability.
- Implement a **real-time feedback system** where customers can rate and provide feedback on the agentâ€™s performance immediately after the task is completed.
- Optimize task allocation to reduce agent travel time, increase efficiency, and ensure **better service delivery** by considering the proximity of agents to tasks.

### **Technology Stack(Could Change later)**:  
- **Backend**:  
  - **Node.js with Express**
  - **PostgreSQL**
  - **Redis**
- **Frontend**:  
  - **React**
  - **Google Maps API**
- **Geolocation Services**:  
  - **Google Geolocation API**
  - **OpenStreetMap**
- **Real-Time Communication**:  
  - **WebSockets**
- **Authentication**:  
  - **JWT**
- **Deployment(Need to learn and apply)**
  - **Docker** and **Kubernetes**: For scalable deployment.
  - **AWS Lambda** (optional): For serverless, real-time feedback processing.

*Justification*:  
Node.js with PostgreSQL provides the scalability and structure required for managing real-time task allocation and feedback systems, while Redis will ensure fast access to frequently used geolocation data. WebSockets allow real-time communication, and Google Maps API will enhance the visual aspect of task allocation.

### **Expected Outcomes**:  
- A **task allocation system** that:
  - Automatically assigns tasks to agents based on their proximity and availability.
  - Minimizes agent travel time by optimizing task assignments using geolocation.
  - Alerts agents about new tasks through real-time notifications.
- A **customer feedback system** that:
  - Enables customers to rate agents and provide feedback immediately after task completion.
  - Displays agent ratings and performance on a dashboard for managers to review.
  - Tracks trends in agent performance and identifies areas for improvement.
- **Impact**:  
  - Increased efficiency in task management by minimizing delays in task assignments.
  - Improved customer satisfaction through real-time feedback and performance tracking.
  - Enhanced decision-making for managers with performance insights and data-driven task assignments.

### **Timeline**:

1. **Week 1-2**:  
   - Gather requirements from the team regarding the rules for task allocation.
   - Set up the Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database to handle task and agent management.
2. **Week 3-4**:  
   - Integrate geolocation services (Google Geolocation API, OpenStreetMap).
   - Build the core task allocation engine that processes geolocation data and assigns tasks.
   - Start building the agent and admin interfaces for task tracking.
3. **Week 5-6**:  
   - Implement WebSockets for real-time task notifications.
   - Start working on the customer feedback system (backend & frontend).
4. **Week 7-8**:  
   - Integrate the customer feedback system with the frontend and backend.
   - Build a dashboard for viewing customer feedback and agent performance analytics.
   - Optimize the task allocation logic to ensure efficient task assignments.
5. **Week 9-10**:  
   - Test the task allocation and feedback systems with mock data.
   - Fix any bugs and ensure scalability using Redis caching and WebSocket performance improvements.
6. **Week 11-12**:  
   - Final testing and deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.
   - Collect final feedback and iterate to improve system performance and user experience.

### **Challenges**:  
- **Real-Time Geolocation Tracking**:  
  Handling real-time updates for a large number of agents without performance bottlenecks.  
  *Solution*: Use Redis to cache location data and WebSockets for fast updates.
- **Feedback System Accuracy**:  
  Ensuring that feedback is tied accurately to the correct agent and task in real-time.  
  *Solution*: Implement strict validation rules on task completion and feedback submission.
- **Scalability**:  
  As the system grows, handling a large volume of geolocation data and feedback submissions will become challenging.  
  *Solution*: Use Docker and Kubernetes to scale services based on the number of agents/customers in the system.
